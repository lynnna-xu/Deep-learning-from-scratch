# Deep-learning-from-scratch
This repository consists of basic implementations of deep learning models. These are homework assigments for an online computer science degree I am doing with Georgia Tech. I am not supposed to share my code. This intro is mainly to showcase the experience I have gained. 
1. Two networks with a simple SGD optimizer from scratch: 
- a simple softmax regression 
- a two-layer multi-layer perceptron
2. A simple CNN architecture from scratch as well as CNNs with PyTorch.
- Convnet
Modules implemented are 2D convolution, 2D Max Pooling, ReLU, and Linear. For each module, a forward pass (computing forwarding results) and a backward pass (computing gradients) are implemented. 
- Pytorch
Vanilla Convolutional Neural Network with a convolution layer, a ReLU activation, a max-pooling layer, followed by a fully connected layer for classification.
3. Data wrangling
- Class-Balanced Focal Loss
4. Natural language processing with Pytorch
- RNN and LSTM
- Seq2seq
- Transformer
